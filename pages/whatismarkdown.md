# What in the Flying F**k is Markdown?

Hello, curious Human! You've stumbled upon a post that aims to demystify **Markdown**, a lightweight markup
language that I use for **13px**. If you're here, it's likely because you're
wondering:
> What in the flying fu** is this Markdown thing everyone keeps talking about?

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to format text using syntax that looks much like regular typing. It was created by **John
Gruber** and **Aaron Swartz** in **2004**, with the goal of making it easy for people to write for the web without having
to learn "complex" HTML or other markup languages.

In essence, Markdown is plain text formatting for everyone. Here's a simple comparison:

- **Regular text**: `*italic*` → Italic
- **HTML**: `<em>italic</em>` → Italic
- **Markdown**: `**bold**` → Bold

## Why use Markdown?

There are numerous benefits to using Markdown:

1. **Simplicity**: Markdown is **easy to learn** and use, with a minimal set of syntax rules.
2. **Consistency**: It's consistent across different platforms, making it great for writing content that'll be
**used in multiple places**.
3. **Versatility**: Markdown can be used to write documentation, **blog posts**, books, even emails!
4. **Readability**: Because Markdown files are **just plain text**, they're easy to read and edit using any text
editor or IDE.

## Resources

Here are some helpful resources to learn more about Markdown:

1. [Markdown Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - The Wikipedia page for Markdown.

version of Markdown.

So, now that you know **what** Markdown is and **why** you should use it and why **I** use it. \
Maybe you can use it also. \
