# Welcome

This is a **blog** crafted from numerous [Markdown](#whatismarkdown) files, sewn together by my fingers and enhanced with a dash of
<strong>AI</strong>.

Curious? Peek under the hood at the source code. It's where the stuff happens!

![Logo in which there is CSS code which sets an element's height to 13px](../img/logo/logobig_transparent.png)
I'm not sure if using "Consolas" as the logo font is okay, so please, no lawsuits! ðŸ¤ž

I will write about something that interests me once in a while.
Be patient it can take a while to write a page. English is not my native language lol

Keep an eye out for more updates â€“ i'll be cooking! âœ¨
