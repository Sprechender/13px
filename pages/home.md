# Welcome

This is a **blog** crafted from numerous [Markdown](#whatismarkdown) files, sewn together by my fingers and enhanced with a dash of
**AI**.

Curious? Peek under the hood at the [source code](https://github.com/Sprechender/13px). It's where the stuff happens!

I'm not sure if using "Consolas" as the logo font is okay, so please, no lawsuits! ðŸ¤ž

I will write about something that interests me once in a while.
My writing style is a work in progress â€“ it may be messy and take some time to develop. I don't speak English
fluently (yet!), but I'm learning. ðŸ˜„

Keep an eye out for more updates â€“ i'll be cooking! âœ¨
