# 13px (the really weird blog by me)
### Welcome to the 13px repo! This project is an example of how to create a simple static (with kinda dynamic content) website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features

* A responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
* A clean and modern UI with easy navigation
* Support for multiple languages
* A dynamic page loading mechanism that allows users to switch between different pages without reloading the entire website
* ~~simple search functionality~~ _(maybe coming soon)_

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository from GitHub and start a web server. You can also just view a live version of the website at <https://marcelschreiber.de/13px> _maybe 13px.blog in the future_.

### Documentation

The documentation for this project is still being written (idk if i need one). In the meantime, you can refer to the source code and comments in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to understand how the different features of the website are implemented.

### Current problems
Way too much stuff in the `script.js` i really need to split it into multiple files. (but i'm too lazy to do it)

### Contributing

If you have any questions or need help getting started, feel free to open an issue.
